## Projects
- **ft_printf**: A custom implementation of the `printf` function.
- **get_next_line**: This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor
- **Born2beRoot**: System Administration related exercise.
- **Minitalk**: The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.
- **FDF**: This project is about representing a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines.
- **Push_swap**: This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.
